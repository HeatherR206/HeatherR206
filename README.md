## Hi there 👋

A bit about me:

🪄 Once upon a time, I was a public school teacher 👩🏻‍🏫. More than two decades later, I am a software engineering student, learning JavaScript, Node.js, React, and so many other new things that my brain just might 🤯!

Since I'm a total web dev noob, I'd love to collaborate on small projects that deepen my understanding of the many tools available to developers. I'm giving my best effort to prioritzing my learning targets but often succumb to my ADHD, which leads me down rabbit holes.

When I take 'me time', I read 📚, OneWheel ‒⭕️‒, play on Canva, chill with friends and family, and attempt to survive my dog's incessant licking 🐶.

Find me on: GitHub, Slack, Linkedin

⭐️ Fun fact: I grew up in 5 different countries 🇹🇼 🇺🇸 🇮🇩 🇸🇬 🇰🇷
